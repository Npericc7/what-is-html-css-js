  <h1>HTML</h1>
  <h2>HTML-(Hyper Text Markup Language) </h2>
  <h3>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.

HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website page. For example, we can create a paragraph by placing the enclosed text within a starting  and closing  tag.</h3>
<h1>The History of HTML</h1>
<h2>HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at the CERN research institute in Switzerland. He came up with the idea of an Internet-based hypertext system.

Hypertext means a text that contains references (links) to other texts that viewers can access immediately. He published the first version of HTML in 1991, consisting of 18 HTML tags. Since then, each new version of the HTML language came with new tags and attributes (tag modifiers) to the markup.

According to Mozilla Developer Network’s HTML Element Reference, currently, there are 140 HTML tags, although some of them are already obsolete (not supported by modern browsers).

Due to a quick rise in popularity, HTML is now considered an official web standard. The HTML specifications are maintained and developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). You can check out the latest state of the language anytime on W3C’s website.

The biggest upgrade of the language was the introduction of HTML5 in 2014. It added several new semantic tags to the markup, that reveal the meaning of their own content, such as.</h2>
<h1>How Does HTML Work?</h1>
<h2>HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. You can view then using any web browser (such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox). The browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.

Usually, the average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance: home pages, about pages, contact pages would all have separate HTML documents.

Each HTML page consists of a set of tags (also called elements), which you can refer to as the building blocks of web pages. They create a hierarchy that structures the content into sections, paragraphs, headings, and other content blocks.</h2>
<h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
<h2>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.

CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.

Advantages of CSS
CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.

Pages load faster − If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.

Easy maintenance − To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.

Superior styles to HTML − CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.

Multiple Device Compatibility − Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.

Global web standards − Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So its a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible to future browsers.

Who Creates and Maintains CSS?
CSS is created and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. The CSS Working Group creates documents called specifications. When a specification has been discussed and officially ratified by the W3C members, it becomes a recommendation.

These ratified specifications are called recommendations because the W3C has no control over the actual implementation of the language. Independent companies and organizations create that software.

NOTE − The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C is a group that makes recommendations about how the Internet works and how it should evolve.

CSS Versions
Cascading Style Sheets level 1 (CSS1) came out of W3C as a recommendation in December 1996. This version describes the CSS language as well as a simple visual formatting model for all the HTML tags.

CSS2 became a W3C recommendation in May 1998 and builds on CSS1. This version adds support for media-specific style sheets e.g. printers and aural devices, downloadable fonts, element positioning and tables.</h2>
<h1>JAVASCRIPT IS USED TO AUTOMATE AND ANIMATE</h1>
<h2>I mentioned above that JavaScript is a “scripting language.” Scripting languages are coding languages used to automate processes that users would otherwise need to execute on their own, step-by-step. Short of scripting, any changes on web pages you visit would require either manually reloading the page, or navigating a series of static menus to get to the content you’re after

A scripting language like JavaScript (JS, for those in the know) does the heavy lifting by telling computer programs like websites or web applications to “do something.” In the case of JavaScript, this means telling those dynamic features described earlier to do whatever it is they do—like telling images to animate themselves, photos to cycle through a slideshow, or autocomplete suggestions to respond to prompts. It’s the “script” in JavaScript that makes these things happen seemingly on their own.

Meanwhile, because JavaScript is such an integral part of web functionality, all major web browsers come with built-in engines that can render JavaScript. This means JS commands can be typed directly into an HTML document, and web browsers will be able to understand them. In other words, using JavaScript doesn’t require downloading any additional programs or compilers.</h2>
<h1> What is JavaScript Used For?
</h1>
<h2>We covered this a bit in the intro, but here’s a quick list of the main things JavaScript is used for.

Adding interactivity to websites—yup, if you want a website to be more than a static page of text, you’ll need to do some JavaScripting
Developing mobile applications—JavaScript isn’t just for websites…it’s used to create those apps you have on your phone and tablet as well
Creating web browser based games—Ever played a game directly from your web browser? JavaScript probably helped make that happen
Back end web development—yeah, JavaScript is MOSTLY used on the front end of things, but it’s a versatile enough scripting language to be used on back end infrastructure, too.</h2>
<h1>How Does JavaScript Work?</h1>
<h2>JavaScript is either embedded into a web page or else it’s included in a .js file. JavaScript is also a “client-side” language (rather than a “server-side” language), which is a fancy way of saying that it gets downloaded to site visitors’ computers, then processed. Voila! JavaScript code can also be added to a page as a separate header file with the extension .js (generally done if it’s code that you want to include across a number of pages at once). The script is then downloaded and processed in each individual’s web browser, turning it into the dynamic objects and effects they see on their screen.

One word of warning, though: since JavaScript is processed by individual browsers, it’s possible a user might have JavaScript disabled on their end. Sites that use JavaScript need to have a back up plan in place to avoid breaking when this happens.</h2>
<h1> What is Vanilla JavaScript?
</h1>
<h2>As you dig into JavaScript you’ll eventually hear the term “vanilla Javascript.” So what does that mean?

Vanilla JavaScript is the JavaScript language “as is” without using any tools to make the coding process easier or more efficient.

To give you an idea of what vanilla JavaScript looks like, consider the following basic example of JavaScript code. If you wanted users to receive a “thanks for signing up” confirmation message after signing up for an offer or service on a website, you would code it directly into an HTML page (between <script> tags) like this:

<script>
window.onload = initAll;
function initAll() {
document.getElementById(“submit”).onclick = submitMessage;
}
function submitMessage() {
var greeting = document.getElementById(“name”).getAttribute(“value”);
document.getElementById(“headline”).innerHTML = “Thank you for joining our email list,” + greeting;
return false;
}
</script>
Vanilla JS like this can be used to create JavaScript projects, but as you become more familiar with the JavaScript language, there are different tools you can implement to make JS easier and more efficient to use.</h2>
<h1>Advanced Javascript: Frameworks and Libraries (AKA Tools to Make JS Easier)</h1>
<h2>As you might imagine, using vanilla javascript alone takes…forever and for web developers, and time is money. That’s why JavaScript frameworks and libraries (tools that make JS a whooole lot easier to use) are your new best friends. Here’s a breakdown of some of the main ones you’ll encounter and what they do.

JQUERY—THE O.G. JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY
When you work with JavaScript, you’ll notice JS functions and features that show up regularly across multiple websites or web apps—things like menu animations and fade outs, file upload forms, and image galleries. While you could code each of these things from the ground up every time you need one, your coding life will feel a lot easier if you use coding libraries like jQuery instead.

The jQuery library is made up of JavaScript coding functions that can be performed through single line jQuery commands. For example, the JavaScript code example above looks like this if it’s performed using jQuery code instead:

 <h1> How to Learn JavaScript
  </h1>
  <h2>The takeaway here? While HTML and CSS are the skills that will let you code a basic web page, JavaScript is the programming language that will bring that page to life. Even though HTML and CSS by themselves will put you in position to do beginning developer work, taking the time to learn JavaScript will help your job prospects increase exponentially.

If you’re ready for a comprehensive JavaScript tutorial, look no further than our Front End Developer Blueprint. This instructor-led course will guide you through the ins and outs of the JavaScript language and the jQuery library, as well as HTML, CSS, and other critical web developer skills.</h2>
